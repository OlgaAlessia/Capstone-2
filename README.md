# What's Cooking


## Using of API:
Utilize an API was one of the requirements for this project.  
I used the [Rebrickable.com](https://rebrickable.com/api/ "https://rebrickable.com/api/") because their API consist of the LEGO Catalog (all official LEGO Sets/Parts data is available, including Minifigs).


## Project Description

The idea was to create a simple application in one week that helps the user find a recipe with a set with the number on the box, by name and find parts.  
Also, the user can add a list in their favorite list to easily access and see that later.
