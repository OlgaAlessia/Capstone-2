# The Art of Lego

## Project Description

The idea was to create a simple application in one week that helps the user find a Lego Set with the number on the box and by name.  
Also, the user can add a list in their favorite list to easily access and see that later. 

I used the [Rebrickable.com](https://rebrickable.com/api/ "https://rebrickable.com/api/") because their API consist of the LEGO Catalog (all official LEGO Sets/Parts data is available, including Minifigs).

## Live Demo:
Check out the [Live demo](https://lego-frontend.onrender.com/ "https://lego-frontend.onrender.com/").
Since this is a demonstration, login with testUser - password


## Tech Stack:
- PostgreSQL as the database.
- Frontend: ReactJS, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
- Backend: NodeJS and Express.
- Authentication: JWT


## The app features are:
- Create an account to search and see 
- Search lego sets by name and by setNumber
- Create and delete a new list
- Choose the list where to save the Lego Set
- See all the information about the Lego Sets
- See the Moc instructions for a lego set


## To-do list:
* Delete the lego set in a list
* Add lego parts 
* Responsive design
* Add more features
* Modify the password 


## Responsive Design
The application is NOT yet designed with a responsive layout, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
